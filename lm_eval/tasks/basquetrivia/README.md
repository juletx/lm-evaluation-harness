BasqueTrivia is a Basque trivia game that consists of around 5000 multiple-choice trivia questions, with 3 candidate answers and a single correct answer.

Questions are divided between local and global topics. Local topics are those that require knowledge about the Basque Country. As for the categories, the questions are classified into eight different areas: Basque and literature, Sports and leisure, Science and technology, Geography and history Culture and art, Cinema and shows, Society and habits, and Music and dance. In each category, questions from both the local and global topics are balanced. Questions also have three levels of difficulty: easy, medium or hard.
